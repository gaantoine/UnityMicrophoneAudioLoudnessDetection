# UnityMicrophoneAudioLoudnessDetection

This is a Unity project I created from a tutorial by Valem Tutorials.  It demonstrates functionality for reading audio input from the microphone and using it to modify the scale of a gameObject in real time.

This project was created in Unity version 6000.0.51f1, which has a known security issue.  I will attempt to update the project to a secure version in the future but for now, please update to a newer version if you plan to incorporate this into a published game.
